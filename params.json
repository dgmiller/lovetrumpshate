I have experience with data visualization, creative writing, and museum exhibit design. Well-designed objects and spaces make the world a better place. My background is in math, stats, and economics. Currently working as a course developer and instructor for a class on analytical visualization and exploratory data analysis, a Junior Data Scientist for Meter Group, and a student in Applied and Computational Mathematics.\r\n\r\nCheck out [my portfolio](http://github.com/dgmiller/portfolio) of projects on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Posts on Medium\r\n\r\n[Data centric vs Model centric Science](https://medium.com/@derekgunthermiller/data-centric-vs-model-centric-e8f163a1d24d#.djic0dc7t)\r\n\r\n[Don't Gamble at College](https://medium.com/@derekgunthermiller/if-you-want-to-gamble-dont-do-it-at-college-d1b0a6ed12fe#.qg1ll9bv2)\r\n\r\n## Favorite Books\r\n\r\n**Thinking Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman\r\n\r\n**The Information** by James Gleick\r\n\r\n**Weapons of Math Destruction** by Cathy O'Neil\r\n\r\n**Moby-Dick** by Herman Melville\r\n\r\n**Zero to One** by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters\r\n\r\n**Creative Confidence** by Tom Kelley and David Kelley\r\n\r\n**Moneyball** by Michael Lewis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Things I like from around the web\r\n\r\n[Data Visualization of Classic Literature](https://www.behance.net/thesarahkay)\r\n\r\n[Visualizing Numerical Optimization Algorithms](http://www.benfrederickson.com/numerical-optimization/)\r\n\r\n[Designing Dialogue YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxOECOtYeZc)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Contact\r\n\r\nemail: derekmiller@byu.edu\r\n\r\ngithub: github.com/dgmiller\r\n\r\nTwitter: @dgmllr\r\n",
