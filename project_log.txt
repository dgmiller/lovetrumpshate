Get plots for the various days leading up to the election.
Link to working with datetime index http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html
Modified the make_test_train function in utils.py; completes the loading process from start to finish.

Starting intial data visualizations. I want text visualization but that might be too much for what we need to do right now.

Things I want to visualize:
-Basic histograms of most of the variables
-See distribution of sentiment
-Visualize retweet subset

segment by tweet vs retweet
        by day or time
        by positive vs negative
        
Finished with a decent dataset where there are only extreme sentiments.

Adding sentiment as the outcome variable. Deleted remove_vars_from_tweet keyword in utils. Also removed tokenize functions.
As a reminder, all these functions are still in my portfolio/capstone repo on GitHub.

Success! I got the sentiment scores into columns in utils.TwitterCorpus.make_df!

Running on all of Trump.txt
It worked!

Things to think about: clustering, naive bayes filtering, lda feature engineering

Ran nltk's vader sentiment package on 100 tweets from election night.
Selecting tweets with a nonzero negative score gave only 9/100.
Selecting tweets with nonzero negative score and a positive score of zero gave 6/100.

Adding tweets with nonzero positive score and a negative score of zero gave 12/100.

30 second elevator pitch: We are using election day tweets to predict how negative Twitter will be on inauguration day.
When we have tuned our algorithm, we want to make it work online in real time. #PresidentialHedonometer
